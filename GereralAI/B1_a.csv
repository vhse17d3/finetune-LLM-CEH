1,"You have successfully logged on a Linux system. You want to now cover your trade Your login attempt may
be logged on several files located in /var/log. Which file does NOT belongs to the list:
A.  user.log
B.  auth.fesg
C.  wtmp
D.  btmp
","The correct answer is B. auth.fesg.

The files listed in the options (A. user.log, C. wtmp, and D. btmp) are all log files related to the authentication and login activities of users on a Linux system.

- user.log is the main log file for user authentication attempts.
- wtmp (or /var/log/wtmp) stores information about user logins, logouts, and other activity related to user sessions.
- btmp (or /var/log/btmp) stores information about failed login attempts.

auth.fesg is a file related to the FESTA (Federal Employees Social Security Trust Administration) system, which is a social security system for federal employees in the United States. It is not typically related to user authentication on a Linux system.

So, auth.fesg is the file that does NOT belong to the list of log files related to user authentication attempts.",B,A,0

A.  Creating backdoors using SQL injection
B.  A Enumerating the databases in the DBMS for the URL
C.  Retrieving SQL statements being executed on the database
D.  Searching database statements at the IP address given
","The correct answer is B: Enumerating the databases in the DBMS for the URL.

This command is using sqlmap, a SQL injection tool, to enumerate the databases in the database management system (DBMS) for the specified URL. The options used are:

- `-u` specifies the URL to use for the sqlmap command. In this case, it's a URL that is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- `http://10.10.1.20/?p=1` is the URL itself, which is being used to inject SQL code.
- `&forumaction=search` is part of the URL, and is likely related to a web application's search functionality.
- `"" -dbs` is the command to enumerate the databases in the DBMS.

The `-dbs` option tells sqlmap to perform a database enumeration and print the names of the databases in the DBMS. This can be a useful step in identifying potential vulnerabilities or gaining access to sensitive data.",B,B,1

4,"Which of the following is assured by the use of a hash?
A.  Authentication
B.  Confidentiality
C.  Availability
D.  Integrity
","The correct answer is D. Integrity.

A hash is a one-way function that takes input data of any size and produces a fixed-size output, known as a hash value or digest. The use of a hash function provides several security benefits, including:

1. Data integrity: A hash ensures that the data has not been altered or tampered with. If the hash value changes, it indicates that the data has been modified.
2. Non-repudiation: A hash allows the sender to prove that they sent the data without being able to deny it.
3. Data authenticity: A hash can be used to verify the authenticity of the data by comparing the hash value of the data with a known hash value.

While a hash can provide some level of integrity, it does not provide the following:

* Authentication (A): A hash alone cannot be used to authenticate the sender or the data, but it can be used in combination with other authentication mechanisms.
* Confidentiality (B): A hash is a publicly available function, so it does not provide confidentiality.
* Availability (C): A hash does not provide availability, as it does not ensure that the data will be accessible or usable.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Integrity.",D,D,1

A.  SYN
B.  ACK
C.  FIN
D.  PSH
E.  RST
F.  No response
","The correct answer is F. No response.

When a NULL scan is performed on a closed port, the operating system responds by not sending any data. The NULL scan is essentially sending a ""no response"" signal, indicating that the port is closed.

The other options are not correct:

A. SYN (synchronous connection establishment) is a response to an incoming connection request, not a response to a NULL scan.

B. ACK (acknowledgment) is a response to data received, not a response to a NULL scan.

C. FIN (finish) is a response to a connection termination request, not a response to a NULL scan.

D. PSH (push) is a response to data being pushed, not a response to a NULL scan.

E. RST (reset) is a response to an invalid connection attempt, but it's not the typical response to a NULL scan.

environment?
A.  Behavioral based
B.  Heuristics based
C.  Honeypot based
D.  Cloud based
","The detection technique being described in the question is a ""Cloud-based"" detection technique.

In cloud-based detection, antivirus software collects data from multiple protected systems and analyzes it in a provider's environment, rather than on the local system itself. This approach allows for more efficient and effective malware detection, as it leverages the collective power of multiple systems and the expertise of the provider's team.

Here's why the other options don't match:

* Behavioral-based (A) detection focuses on observing the behavior of the malware on a local system, rather than analyzing it in a cloud environment.
* Heuristics-based (B) detection uses rules and algorithms to identify malware, but doesn't necessarily involve cloud-based analysis.
* Honeypot-based (C) detection involves setting up a decoy system to attract and detect malware, but doesn't necessarily involve cloud-based analysis.

8,"Which type of security feature stops vehicles from crashing through the doors of a building?
A.  Bollards
B.  Receptionist
C.  Mantrap
D.  Turnstile
","The correct answer is C. Mantrap.

A mantrap is a security feature that consists of two doors, one leading into a small room or area, and another that leads out. When a vehicle tries to crash through the doors, the inner door closes, trapping the vehicle inside and preventing it from reaching the outer door. The outer door can then be locked, preventing further access.

Bollards are metal or concrete barriers used to block or restrict access to an area, but they do not prevent vehicles from crashing through doors.

A receptionist is a person who greets and handles visitors at a building, but they do not have any physical security features.

A turnstile is a device used to control the flow of people into or out of a restricted area, but it does not prevent vehicles from crashing through doors.",A,A,1

A.  Network elements must be hardened with user ids and strong passwords. Regular security tests and audits should be performed.
B.  As long as the physical access to the network elements is restricted, there is no need for additional measures.
C.  There is no need for specific security measures on the network elements as long as firewalls and IPSsystems exist.
D.  The operator knows that attacks and down time are inevitable and should have a backup site.
","The correct answer is A. Network elements must be hardened with user ids and strong passwords. Regular security tests and audits should be performed.

Here's why:

* Network elements, despite being behind a firewall and IPS system, are still potential targets for advanced persistent threats (APTs) and insider threats. Hardening these elements with strong passwords, user IDs, and limiting privileges can prevent unauthorized access and minimize the risk of compromise.
* Regular security tests and audits can help identify vulnerabilities and ensure that security controls are effective in detecting and preventing attacks.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
* B: Physical access can still be compromised through insider threats or social engineering attacks, so additional security measures are necessary.
* C: Firewalls and IPS systems are not a substitute for securing network elements themselves. Hardening these elements is essential to prevent unauthorized access.
* D: While having a backup site is a good practice, it does not address the security of the primary data center or network elements.

D.  Zone transfer
","The correct answer is A. DNSSEC.

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that provide origin authentication of DNS data to DNS clients (resolvers). This helps to reduce the threat of DNS poisoning, spoofing, and similar types of attacks.

DNSSEC provides several key features, including:

1. Digital signatures: Each DNS response is signed with a digital signature that ensures the data has not been tampered with during transmission.
2. Hashes: A unique hash is generated for each DNS response, making it possible to verify the authenticity of the data.
3. Key management: DNSSEC uses a hierarchical key management system to manage the public keys used for signing DNS responses.

By using DNSSEC, DNS clients can verify the authenticity of DNS responses and detect any tampering or spoofing attempts. This provides an additional layer of security for the DNS protocol and helps to prevent attacks such as DNS poisoning and spoofing.

The other options are not correct:

* B. Resource records refer to the actual data stored in DNS, such as IP addresses and domain names.

C.  The attacker altered or erased events from the logs.
D.  The security breach was a false positive.
","The most likely cause of the discrepancy in the sequence of logged events is:

A. The network devices are not all synchronized.

This is because network devices such as firewalls, proxy servers, and IDS systems often use internal clocks or clocks that are not synchronized with each other.

This is a common issue in network security monitoring and incident response.

The other options are less likely causes:

* B. Proper chain of custody was not observed while collecting the logs: This would more likely result in a discrepancy in the originality of the logs rather than their sequence.
* C. The attacker altered or erased events from the logs: This would be a deliberate action by the attacker, which is unlikely in the context of an incident where the logs are being collected for investigation.

17,"This wireless security protocol allows 192-bit minimum-strength security protocols and cryptographic tools to
protect sensitive data, such as GCMP-2S6. MMAC-SHA384, and ECDSA using a 384-bit elliptic curve.
Which is this wireless security protocol?
A.  WPA2 Personal
B.  WPA3-Personal
C.  WPA2-Enterprise
D.  WPA3-Enterprise
","To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information about the wireless security protocol.

The given information states that the protocol allows 192-bit minimum-strength security protocols and cryptographic tools to protect sensitive data. This is typically associated with the AES-192 (Advanced Encryption Standard - 192-bit) algorithm, which is a symmetric encryption method used for AES.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. WPA2 Personal: WPA2 uses AES-128 (128-bit) for personal networks and AES-256 (256-bit) for enterprise networks. It does not use AES-192.

B. WPA3-Personal: WPA3 uses AES-128 (128-bit) for personal networks.

C. WPA2-Enterprise: WPA2 uses AES-256 (256-bit) for enterprise networks.

D. WPA3-Enterprise: WPA3 also uses AES-256 (256-bit) for enterprise networks.

However, the WPA2 Enterprise and WPA3 Enterprise use AES-256, while WPA2 Personal and WPA3 Personal use AES-128. The mention of 192-bit AES suggests that it could be WPA2 Enterprise or WPA3 Enterprise since they use AES-256. 

Since both options C and D use AES-256, we need to look for any other distinguishing features of the question that can help us choose the best answer. 

A key difference between WPA2-Enterprise and WPA3-Enterprise is the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). 

Given that the question mentions a 384-bit elliptic curve (ECDSA), this strongly suggests that it is WPA3-Enterprise, as WPA3-Enterprise supports the use of 384-bit ECC (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Use ExifTool and check for malicious content: ExifTool is a powerful tool that can analyze the metadata of files, including image files. While it may not be the best tool for detecting malware, it can be used to check for malicious content, such as EXIF data that may indicate the presence of malware.

B. You do not check; rather, you immediately restore a previous snapshot of the operating system: This option is incorrect because if the friend's computer is infected, restoring a previous snapshot may not be enough to remove the malware. It's essential to investigate and diagnose the issue before taking corrective action.

C. Upload the file to VirusTotal: Uploading the file to VirusTotal is an excellent idea. VirusTotal is a reputable online service that scans files for malware using multiple antivirus engines. If the file is infected, it will likely return a positive result, indicating that the file contains malware.

D. Use netstat and check for outgoing connections to strange IP addresses or domains: This option is a good starting point for identifying potential network activity related to malware. Netstat can be used to monitor outgoing connections, and checking for unusual activity can help identify potential issues.

However, I would recommend combining options C and D, as uploading the file to VirusTotal can provide more comprehensive information about the file's malware status, while checking for outgoing connections with netstat can help identify potential network activity related to the malware.

Additional tests that may be useful include:

- Running a full scan with an antivirus software
- Checking for suspicious processes or registry entries
- Monitoring system logs for unusual activity
- Scanning for rootkits or other types of malware

The NOP (No Operation) instruction is used to occupy a specific location in memory, preventing the CPU from executing a different instruction. The hexadecimal value of a NOP instruction is `0x90`.

In the context of your exploit, the NOP sled is used to fill the gap in the buffer to prevent the shellcode from being overwritten. The NOP instructions will be executed by the CPU until it reaches the shellcode, at which point it will execute the actual instructions.

D.  Yancey is a Hacktivist Hacker since he is standing up to a company that is downsizing
","The correct answer is B. Since Yancey does not care about going to jail, he would be considered a Black Hat hacker.

Black Hat hackers are individuals who engage in malicious activities, such as creating and deploying logic bombs, viruses, Trojans, and backdoors, with the intention of causing harm or disrupting computer systems. They often operate outside the law and do not care about the consequences of their actions.

White Hat hackers, on the other hand, are individuals who work to improve the security of computer systems, identify vulnerabilities, and report them to the owners. They typically operate within the law and work to help organizations improve their security.

Suicide hackers are not a widely recognized term in the context of hacking. Some people might refer to individuals who engage in self-destructive or suicidal behavior as ""suicide hackers,"" but this term is not commonly used in the hacking community.

Hacktivist hackers are individuals who engage in hacking activities with the intention of drawing attention to a social or political issue, rather than for personal gain.

28,"Why containers are less secure that virtual machines?
A.  Host OS on containers has a larger surface attack.
B.  Containers may full fill disk space of the host.
C.  A compromise container may cause a CPU starvation of the host.
D.  Containers are attached to the same virtual network.
","The correct answer is A: Host OS on containers has a larger surface attack.

Here's why:

1. **Shared kernel**: Containerized applications run on the same kernel as the host operating system. Since the kernel is shared, it can be vulnerable to attacks that target the kernel. This can lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain control over the entire system.

In contrast, virtual machines run their own isolated kernel, which is a separate piece of software from the host OS kernel. This isolation provides a higher level of security, as an attack on the virtual machine kernel is not accessible to the host OS.

The other options are not correct:

- B: Containers do not occupy the entire disk space of the host. They typically use a small portion of the host's disk space, and their storage is isolated from the host's file system.
- C: A compromised container may not cause CPU starvation of the host. While a compromised container can potentially impact the host's performance, it is not likely to cause CPU starvation, which is a condition where a system's CPU is unable to complete tasks due to resource constraints.
- D: Containers are not attached to the same virtual network as the host. In fact, containers typically use the host's network stack, which means they are isolated from the host's network traffic.",A,A,1

C.  Depending on the switch manufacturer, the device will either delete every entry in its ARP cache or reroute packets to the nearest switch.
D.  The switches will route all traffic to the broadcast address created collisions.
","The correct answer is C: Depending on the switch manufacturer, the device will either delete every entry in its ARP cache or reroute packets to the nearest switch.

When a switch's ARP cache is flooded, it can lead to a phenomenon called a ""MAC flood"". This can cause the switch to:

- Relearn the MAC addresses of the devices in the network, which can lead to a complete ARP table being rewritten.
- In some cases, the switch may reroute packets to the nearest switch, to try and find the original destination.

However, it is not possible for a switch to automatically drop into hub mode or pix mode in response to an ARP flood attack. Hub mode is an older mode of operation used by hubs, while pix mode is a specific configuration mode of the PIX firewall.

It's also worth noting that flooding the ARP cache is not likely to cause the switches to route all traffic to the broadcast address created, as ARP cache flooding primarily affects the routing table of the switch, not the routing of traffic.

Finally, it is not true that the switches will delete every entry in their ARP cache in response to flooding, as each manufacturer may handle ARP cache flooding differently.",C,A,0
33,"what firewall evasion scanning technique make use of a zombie system that has low network activity as well
as its fragment identification numbers?
A.  Decoy scanning
B.  Packet fragmentation scanning
C.  Spoof source address scanning
D.  Idle scanning
","The correct answer is B. Packet fragmentation scanning.

Packet fragmentation scanning is a technique used by attackers to evade detection by firewalls and intrusion detection systems. It involves using a zombie system (also known as a bot) that is not actively communicating with the network. The attacker then sends packets from the zombie system, which are fragmented into smaller pieces, making it difficult for the firewall to detect and block the traffic.

The fragment identification numbers (FIDs) are used to identify the fragments of the packet. Firewalls typically use FIDs to identify and block packets that are being fragmented. By using a zombie system with low network activity and its fragment identification numbers, an attacker can evade detection by firewalls.

Here's how it works:

1. The attacker compromises a zombie system and configures it to send packets to the target system.
2. The attacker fragments the packet into smaller pieces, using the FIDs to identify each fragment.
3. The zombie system sends the fragmented packets to the target system, which is not actively communicating with the network.
4. The firewall detects the fragmented packets and blocks them, but the FIDs are used to identify the fragments, making it difficult to detect and block the entire packet.

D.  Reload from a previous backup
E.  Reload from known good media
","The correct answer is E. Reload from known good media.

If you discover that a rootkit has been installed on one of your computers, the best course of action is to reload from known good media. This involves booting from a clean, bootable USB drive or CD/DVD containing a known good operating system and all necessary software. This approach is considered the safest method for several reasons:

1. It ensures that the computer is completely isolated from any infected files or processes.
2. It prevents the rootkit from loading and executing, making it more difficult for the attacker to maintain control.
3. It allows you to start with a clean slate, free from any possible malware or unauthorized modifications.
4. It reduces the risk of data loss or corruption.

The other options are not recommended because:

A. Copying system files from a known good system could potentially copy the rootkit as well, allowing the attacker to maintain control.

B. Performing a trap and trace could be detected by the rootkit, allowing the attacker to stay informed about your actions.

C. Deleting files and trying to determine the source can be a time-consuming and potentially ineffective process, as rootkits are designed to hide their presence.

D. Reloading from a previous backup may not be possible if the rootkit has altered the system configuration or deleted critical files.

48,"How is the public key distributed in an orderly, controlled fashion so that the users can be sure of the sender?s
identity?
A.  Hash value
B.  Private key
C.  Digital signature
D.  Digital certificate
","The correct answer is D. Digital certificate.

In a digital signature scheme, the public key is distributed in a controlled fashion through a digital certificate. A digital certificate is a file that contains public information about a user or entity, such as their name, public key, and identifier. The certificate is issued by a trusted third-party organization called a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA verifies the identity of the entity and ensures that the public key is correct.

When a user wants to send a message to another user, they use the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. The recipient can then use their private key to decrypt the message, ensuring that it came from the claimed sender.

Here's how the public key is distributed in an orderly, controlled fashion:

1. The user applies for a digital certificate from the CA.
2. The CA verifies the user's identity and issues a digital certificate containing their public key and identifier.
3. The CA signs the certificate with their own private key, creating a digital signature.
4. The digital certificate is sent to the user, who stores it securely.
5. When the user wants to send a message to another user, they use the recipient's public key from the digital certificate to encrypt the message.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Hash value is a one-way function that takes input data and produces a fixed-size string of characters, but it is not used to distribute public keys.
* B. Private key is used for decryption, but it is not distributed publicly.
* C. Digital signature is used to verify the authenticity of a digital certificate, but it is not used to distribute public keys.",D,D,1

D.  Man-in-the-disk attack
","The correct answer is D. Man-in-the-disk attack.

In this scenario, Clark has infected the public computer with malware, which allows Clark to remotely access and control the computer. When Steven connects his iPhone to the infected computer using iTunes WI-FI sync, Clark can use the infected computer as a ""man-in-the-disk"" (MITD) to access and monitor Steven's iPhone activity. This is because the iPhone is syncing its data with the infected computer, allowing Clark to intercept and read Steven's activity on the iPhone even after the device is disconnected from the internet.

Man-in-the-disk attacks involve using a compromised device or network to intercept and read data from a device that is syncing its data with that device or network. This is a type of attacks that exploits the trust and synchronization process between devices.

The other options are not correct:

- iOS trustjacking is not a widely recognized term, but it could be related to the concept of trusting and trusting of a compromised device.
- iOS Jailbreaking is the process of bypassing the security restrictions on an iPhone or iPad by installing software that is not approved by Apple. While jailbreaking can be used to gain unauthorized access to an iPhone, it is not the same as the attack described in the scenario.

following is appropriate to analyze?
A.  IDS log
B.  Event logs on domain controller
C.  Internet Firewall/Proxy log.
D.  Event logs on the PC
","In this situation, to analyze the severity of the situation, we need to identify why the PC is connected to a blacklisted IP address. Here's what each option can provide:

A. IDS log: The IDS (Intrusion Detection System) log can provide information about the alerts received, including the blacklisted IP address, the time of the alert, and the system affected. However, it might not provide information about the connection details.

B. Event logs on domain controller: The event logs on the domain controller can provide information about the domain membership, authentication, and other security-related events. This can help identify if the PC is trying to connect to the blacklisted IP address as part of a domain-joined activity or if it's a rogue connection.

C. Internet Firewall/Proxy log: The Internet Firewall/Proxy log can provide information about the traffic that has been allowed or blocked by the firewall or proxy server. This can help identify if the blacklisted IP address was checked before the connection was established.

D. Event logs on the PC: The event logs on the PC can provide information about the system's activity, including network connections, user logon, and other system events. This can help identify if the PC is trying to connect to the blacklisted IP address independently or as part of a system activity.

Based on the situation, the most relevant information to analyze would be the Internet Firewall/Proxy log (option C). This is because the blacklisted IP address was not detected until just before the alert, suggesting that the firewall or proxy server did not block the connection. By analyzing the firewall/proxy log, we can determine if the blacklisted IP address was checked before the connection was established and if the firewall/proxy server was configured to block it.

Additionally, analyzing the event logs on the PC (option D) can provide more information about the system's activity and help identify if the PC is trying to connect to the blacklisted IP address independently or as part of a system activity.

In summary, the recommended steps would be to:

1. Analyze the IDS log to confirm the alert.
2. Analyze the Internet Firewall/Proxy log to determine if the blacklisted IP address was checked before the connection was established.
3. Analyze the event logs on the PC to understand the system's activity and confirm if the PC is trying to connect to the blacklisted IP address.",C,C,1

","The correct answer is C. The outgoing TCP/IP fingerprinting is blocked by the host firewall.

Explanation:
When nmap is attempting to perform a TCP/IP fingerprint, it is making a request to the target host's operating system to identify itself. However, by default, many modern operating systems, such as Linux and Windows, have a feature called ""TCP SYN scanning prevention"" or ""ICMP SYN scanning prevention"" to prevent unauthorized services from being scanned. This feature blocks incoming TCP SYN packets, which is what nmap is trying to do during the fingerprinting process.

This is why nmap is displaying the ""QUITTING!"" message, indicating that the scan was terminated due to the target host's firewall blocking the outgoing TCP/IP fingerprinting request.

","The best Linux pipe to achieve this milestone would be:

B. `curl -s https://site.com | grep ""??< a href=\?http"" | grep ""site.com""`

Here's a breakdown of why this is the best option:

- `curl -s https://site.com`: This uses `curl` to fetch the HTML of the website and redirects standard output to `/dev/stdout` using the `-s` flag, which makes the command silent.
- `grep ""??< a href=\?http""`: This uses `grep` to find all occurrences of HTML link tags (`<a href`) that contain a protocol (`http`) in the HTML of the website.
- `grep ""site.com""`: This uses `grep` again to filter the output to only include URLs that contain `site.com`, effectively extracting all links on the page.

The other options are not as effective or accurate:

- A: This uses `dirb` to brute-force directory traversal attacks, which is not relevant to this task.
- C: This uses `wget` to download the HTML of the website, but it doesn't filter the output to extract only the links.
- D: This uses `wget` to download the HTML of the website, but it doesn't use `grep` to extract the links.

Here's the complete command with output:

C.  Both pharming and phishing attacks are purely technical and are not considered forms of social engineering
D.  Both pharming and phishing attacks are identical
","The correct answer is B. 

In a pharming attack, a victim is redirected to a fake website by:

- Modifying their host configuration file
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS

In a phishing attack, an attacker provides the victim with a URL that is either misspelled or looks very similar to the actual website's domain name.

Pharming attacks are a type of online fraud where an attacker redirects a user to a fake website by modifying DNS settings, usually through a compromised router or DNS server. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive information from users without actually sending them a malicious email or website.

Phishing attacks, on the other hand, involve an attacker sending a malicious email or message that tricks users into revealing sensitive information. The malicious link or attachment in the email may look legitimate, but it can actually be a phishing attempt.

The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A incorrectly describes phishing attacks, where the attacker provides a URL that is either misspelled or looks similar to the actual website's domain name.
- Option C is incorrect because while both types of attacks can be technical and involve manipulation, they also rely on social engineering tactics to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.
- Option D is incorrect because pharming and phishing attacks are not identical, but rather serve the same purpose: to trick users into revealing sensitive information.",A,A,1

A.  Dark web footprinting
B.  VoIP footpnnting
C.  VPN footprinting
D.  website footprinting
","Based on the scenario, the correct answer is A. Dark web footprinting.

In the scenario, Louis is using specialized tools or search engines to encrypt his browsing activity and navigate anonymously to obtain sensitive information about official government databases. This suggests that he is using the dark web to hide his tracks and gather information that is not publicly available.

Dark web footprinting refers to the practice of searching for and discovering hidden or anonymous websites, forums, and databases on the dark web, which is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires specialized tools to access.

The other options do not match the scenario:

- VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) footprinting refers to tracking a person's voice communications over the internet, which is not relevant to Louis's activities.
- VPN (Virtual Private Network) footprinting refers to tracking a person's online activity by analyzing their VPN traffic, but the scenario does not mention VPN usage.
- Website footprinting refers to tracking a website's online activity, but the scenario does not mention tracking a website's activity.

A.  When an attacker implements a vulnerability scanner to identify weaknesses
B.  When an attacker creates a complete profile of the site's external links and file structures
C.  When an attacker gathers system-level data, including account details and server names
D.  When an attacker uses a brute-force attack to crack a web-server password
","The correct answer is B. When an attacker creates a complete profile of the site's external links and file structures.

Web server footprinting is a process where an attacker gathers information about a web server's configuration, including its directory structure, file integrity, and potential vulnerabilities. This can be done by analyzing the server's HTTP responses, headers, and error messages to gather information about the server's operating system, software versions, and configuration.

Footprinting involves creating a profile of the site's external links and file structures to identify potential entry points for exploitation, understand the server's architecture, and discover potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This information can be used to inform further attacks, such as scanning for vulnerabilities or attempting to exploit them.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Vulnerability scanning is a different process that involves identifying known vulnerabilities in a system or application, whereas footprinting is about gathering information about the system's configuration and architecture.

C. System-level data gathering typically involves accessing the system directly and gathering information from within, which is not the primary focus of web server footprinting.

D. Brute-force attacks are a type of exploitation that involves attempting to guess a password or other authentication factor, but this is not related to the process of footprinting.",B,B,1

TTL: 64 Window Size: 5840
What is the OS running on the target machine?
A.  Solaris OS
B.  Windows OS
C.  Mac OS
D.  Linux OS
","To determine the OS running on the target machine, we need to analyze the given information: TTL (Time To Live, 64) and the TCP window size (5840).

In the TCP/IP protocol, the TTL value is used to implement the Time To Live (TTL) mechanism, which limits the number of hops a packet can make before it is discarded. The TTL value is set by the IP layer, and it is usually derived from the IP header's Minimum Time To Live (MTU) field.

The TCP window size, on the other hand, is related to the underlying operating system's network stack and TCP implementation.

Looking at the options:

A. Solaris OS: Solaris typically uses a fixed TCP window size of 5840, which is the default value for TCP. This value is used on most modern Solaris systems.

B. Windows OS: Windows typically uses a fixed TCP window size of 5840, but the TTL value is usually set to a smaller value, around 64.

C. Mac OS: The default TCP window size for Mac OS is typically 5840, but the TTL value is usually set to a smaller value, around 64.

D. Linux OS: Linux typically uses a variable TCP window size, which can be adjusted dynamically based on the system load and network conditions.

Based on the given information, the most likely OS running on the target machine is Solaris, as it typically uses a fixed TCP window size of 5840 and a TTL value of 64.

D.  -sF
","To determine whether the firewall is stateful or stateless, you would need to use a scan type that can reveal information about the firewall's behavior.

- Option A, `-sA`, is the SYN scan, which can reveal information about active ports and the firewall's ability to block incoming traffic. However, it may not be able to distinguish between stateful and stateless firewalls.

- Option B, `-sX`, is the Xmas scan or FIN scan, which scans all 64 ports at once. It can reveal information about ports that are open and closed, but it's not the best option to determine the type of firewall.

- Option C, `-sT`, is the Connect scan, which sends a SYN packet to a host and waits for a response. This scan can reveal information about active ports and the firewall's behavior, but it may not be the best option for distinguishing between stateful and stateless firewalls.

- Option D, `-sF`, is the Fast scan, which scans all ports using the TCP SYN packet, but it only sends the SYN packet and doesn't wait for a response. This scan can reveal information about open ports and the firewall's behavior, but it's not the best option for determining the type of firewall.

The best option to use in this scenario is `-sA`, as it scans all ports and can reveal information about the firewall's behavior, including whether it's stateful or stateless.

However, it's worth noting that determining whether a firewall is stateful or stateless typically involves using a tool like `tcpdump` or Wireshark to analyze the packet captures, rather than relying solely on the Nmap scan results.

Here's an example of how you can use the `-sA` option in Nmap to scan the host:

Explanation:
Insecure direct object reference occurs when an application does not verify the user's access rights based on the object's name or key. In this case, request C exploits this vulnerability.

Here's why:
- The request is a GET request to `/restricted/accounts/` with a query parameter `?name=Ned`.
- The application assumes that the `accounts` endpoint is only accessible to administrators or users with a specific role.
- However, the malicious user Ned can manipulate the request to bypass the access control mechanism by providing the name of his account as the query parameter.
- Since the application does not verify the user's access rights based on the object's name or key, Ned can gain unauthorized access to his own account.

This is a classic example of an insecure direct object reference vulnerability, where an attacker can exploit the application's lack of proper access control to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.",C,C,1

C. Piggybacking

Piggybacking is a type of tailgating where an authorized individual (in this case, the employee) allows an unauthorized individual to follow them into a secure area, such as a building. This can compromise the security of the area and the individuals working there.

Tailgating is a broader term that refers to the act of allowing someone to follow closely behind you into a secure area without being checked or cleared. However, piggybacking specifically involves an unauthorized individual following an authorized individual into a secure area.

Reverse Social Engineering is not a recognized term in the context of physical security breaches.

","The correct answer is B. Can identify unknown attacks.

Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) work by identifying network traffic patterns that are significantly different from known patterns. They can detect unknown attacks or unusual behavior that is not yet in their signature database. This makes them more effective against advanced threats, zero-day attacks, and unknown malware.

Signature-based IDS, on the other hand, relies on pre-defined signatures of known attacks and malware. While they can detect known threats, they may not be able to detect unknown attacks or attacks that are similar to known attacks but with slight variations.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Anomaly-based IDS can actually produce more false positives due to the increased sensitivity to unusual traffic patterns.

A.  Detecting honeypots running on VMware
B.  Detecting the presence of Honeyd honeypots
C.  Detecting the presence of Snort_inline honeypots
D.  Detecting the presence of Sebek-based honeypots
","To determine which technique Dayn is employing, let's briefly describe each option:

A. Detecting honeypots running on VMware: This technique is not directly related to time-based TCP fingerprinting. VMware is a virtualization platform, and detecting honeypots running on it would require a different approach.

B. Detecting the presence of Honeyd honeypots: Honeyd is a type of honeypot that uses a combination of virtualization and network monitoring to mimic a network interface. Time-based TCP fingerprinting is a technique that measures the time it takes for a system to respond to a series of TCP SYN packets. By comparing the response times of a normal computer and a honeypot, Dayn could potentially detect the presence of a Honeyd honeypot.

C. Detecting the presence of Snort_inline honeypots: Snort_inline is a honeypot that uses inline packet inspection to monitor network traffic. While Snort_inline does use network monitoring, time-based TCP fingerprinting is not the primary technique for detecting its presence.

D. Detecting the presence of Sebek-based honeypots: Sebek is a type of honeypot that uses a combination of virtualization and network monitoring. However, there is no direct connection between Sebek-based honeypots and time-based TCP fingerprinting.

","The correct answer is A. A request sent by a malicious user from a browser to a server.

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a web application that the user is authenticated to. This is typically done by sending a malicious request from the user's browser to the server, without the user's knowledge or consent.

Here's how it works:

1. An attacker obtains a session cookie from a user's browser, often through phishing or other means.
2. The attacker uses the session cookie to create a malicious request to the server, which is indistinguishable from a legitimate request.
3. The user's browser sends the malicious request to the server, which then authenticates the request and performs the unintended action.

133,"Which type of attack attempts to overflow the content-addressable memory (CAM) table in an Ethernet
switch?
A.  Evil twin attack
B.  DNS cache flooding
C.  MAC flooding
D.  DDoS attack
","The correct answer is C. MAC flooding.

MAC flooding is a type of attack that attempts to overflow the content-addressable memory (CAM) table in an Ethernet switch by flooding the switch with spoofed MAC addresses. The CAM table is a data structure used to store MAC addresses and their corresponding IP addresses for fast forwarding of packets. By flooding the switch with spoofed MAC addresses, the attacker can cause the switch to flush its CAM table, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

Here's how it works:

1. The attacker sends a large number of packets with spoofed source MAC addresses to the switch.
2. Each packet is not destined for any specific device on the network, but rather is intended to be broadcast to all devices.
3. The switch attempts to forward each packet based on the MAC address in the packet's source field.
4. Since the MAC addresses are spoofed, the switch does not know which device to forward the packet to, and it will eventually overwrite the CAM table.
5. Once the CAM table is flushed, the switch will no longer be able to forward packets, causing a denial-of-service condition.

This type of attack can be launched remotely and can be used to disrupt network services or to steal sensitive information.",C,C,1

B.  All uppercase character passwords
C.  Password salting
D.  Lockout accounts under brute force password cracking attempts
","The correct answers are:

A. Use of non-dictionary words
C. Password salting

Here's why:

A. Using non-dictionary words can make it harder for rainbow tables to crack passwords. Dictionary attacks rely on precomputed tables of common words and phrases. Using non-dictionary words, such as random combinations of characters, can make it more difficult for attackers to use these tables.

C. Password salting is a technique where a unique string of characters is added to the password before hashing. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use rainbow tables, as the tables are typically precomputed for a specific hash function and salt. By changing the salt for each password, you can make it harder for attackers to use precomputed tables.

The other options are not correct:

B. Using all uppercase character passwords does not make it harder for rainbow tables to crack. Rainbow tables are typically precomputed for lowercase letters and can still be used to crack uppercase passwords.

","The correct answer is C.  He is scanning from 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.78 because of the mask /28 and the servers are not in that range.

Here's why:

- The network address is 192.168.1.64 with the mask 255.255.255.192.
- The mask 255.255.255.192 is a /27 mask, not /28. The /27 mask means 27 bits are used for host addresses, leaving 5 bits for the network address.
- The /27 mask means the range of host addresses is from 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.67 (since 2^5 = 32, and we subtract 2 from 32 to account for the network address and the broadcast address).
- The servers are at 192.168.1.122, 192.168.1.123, and 192.168.1.124, which are outside this range.

C.  Phishing
D.  Tap 'n ghost attack
","In the scenario described, the attack performed on Ben is likely a ""Phishing"" attack, specifically ""Advanced SMS Phishing"" or ""SIM Swap Scam"".

Here's why:

1. Ben received a message with a PIN from the network operator, which is unusual and potentially suspicious.
2. The message asks him to enter the PIN again, which suggests that the message is trying to trick him into revealing sensitive information.
3. The fact that Ben's smartphone started functioning abnormally after entering the PIN indicates that the message may have been malicious.

Advanced SMS phishing is a type of attack where attackers send fake SMS messages to victims, often asking them to reveal sensitive information, such as passwords or PINs. In this case, the attacker may have sent a fake message from the network operator's SMS system, making it appear as if it's from a legitimate source.

","The correct answer is B. Blind SQLi.

Blind SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of injection attack where an attacker attempts to inject malicious SQL code into a web application based on responses to True/False questions or user input. This type of attack is ""blind"" because the attacker does not know the exact SQL queries being executed on the database, but instead relies on the response to determine the success of the injection attempt.

In Blind SQLi attacks, the attacker uses the response to True/False questions (e.g. ""Is the user 'admin'?"") to infer whether their injection attempt was successful, and then adjusts their next attempt accordingly. This requires a good understanding of the web application's behavior and responses to different inputs.

The other options are not correct:

A. ""Use Alternate Data Streams to hide the outgoing packets from this server."" - Alternate Data Streams (ADS) are a feature of the NTFS file system that allows a file to have multiple streams. While ADS can be used to hide files from the operating system, it is not a reliable method to evade IDS systems.

B. ""Use HTTP so that all traffic can be routed vis a browser, thus evading the internal Intrusion Detection Systems."" - While using HTTP to route traffic through a browser can make it more difficult to detect, it is not a foolproof method. IDS systems can be configured to detect HTTP traffic, and a malicious actor could still use other protocols (such as HTTPS or SSH) to evade detection.

D. ""Install and use Telnet to encrypt all outgoing traffic from this server."" - Telnet is a protocol that transmits data in plaintext, and using it to encrypt outgoing traffic would actually make it more detectable. IDS systems can flag Telnet traffic as suspicious, and encrypting it would only make it easier to detect.

In summary, installing and using Cryptcat to encrypt outgoing packets from a compromised server is the best approach to evade IDS systems and maintain network activity undetected.",C,C,1
140,"John, a professional hacker, decided to use DNS to perform data exfiltration on a target network, in this
process, he embedded malicious data into the DNS protocol packets that even DNSSEC cannot detect. Using
this technique. John successfully injected malware to bypass a firewall and maintained communication with
the victim machine and C&C server. What is the technique employed by John to bypass the firewall?
A.  DNS cache snooping
B.  DNSSEC zone walking
C.  DNS tunneling method
D.  DNS enumeration
","The correct answer is C. DNS tunneling method.

DNS tunneling is a technique where a hacker embeds malicious data within DNS protocol packets, making it difficult to detect by security controls such as firewalls. This technique allows the hacker to bypass network security measures and exfiltrate data or establish communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server.

By embedding malicious data into DNS packets, John was able to inject malware into the network, bypassing the firewall, and maintain communication with the victim machine and the C&C server.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. DNS cache snooping refers to the unauthorized access to DNS cache data, which is not related to bypassing firewalls through malicious DNS packets.

B. DNSSEC zone walking is a legitimate process used to analyze and verify DNSSEC zones, which is not related to bypassing firewalls through malicious DNS packets.

D. DNS enumeration is the process of gathering information about a DNS server or zone, which is not related to bypassing firewalls through malicious DNS packets.

In summary, John employed DNS tunneling method, which allows malicious data to be embedded within DNS packets, bypassing firewalls and security controls.",C,C,1
141,"Which iOS jailbreaking technique patches the kernel during the device boot so that it becomes jailbroken after
each successive reboot?
A.  Tethered jailbreaking
B.  Semi-tethered jailbreaking
C.  Untethered jailbreaking
D.  Semi-Untethered jailbreaking
","The correct answer is C. Untethered jailbreaking.

Untethered jailbreaking allows the jailbroken kernel to remain active even after a reboot. This is typically achieved by patching the kernel during the device boot process, so that the kernel is modified permanently and the device becomes jailbroken after each successive reboot.

Tethered jailbreaking (A) requires the device to be connected to a computer in order to bootstrap the jailbroken kernel, which is why it's called ""tethered"". Semi-tethered jailbreaking (B) also requires some form of connectivity, but it can be ""un-jailbroken"" by re-jailbreaking the device. Semi-Untethered jailbreaking (D) is not a recognized term in the context of iOS jailbreaking.

So, untethered jailbreaking is the correct answer, as it allows the device to become jailbroken after each successive reboot without any external connectivity.",C,C,1

144,"Firewalls are the software or hardware systems that are able to control and monitor the traffic coming in and
out the target network based on pre-defined set of rules. Which of the following types of firewalls can protect
against SQL injection attacks?
A.  Data-driven firewall
B.  Packet firewall
C.  Web application firewall
D.  Stateful firewall
","The correct answer is C. Web Application Firewall.

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a type of firewall that is specifically designed to protect web applications from attacks, including SQL injection attacks. It monitors and controls traffic coming in and out of the web application based on a set of predefined rules, which include rules to prevent SQL injection attacks.

SQL injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database in order to extract or modify sensitive data. A WAF can help prevent these types of attacks by analyzing incoming traffic and blocking any requests that contain malicious SQL code.

In contrast, the other options do not specifically address the protection against SQL injection attacks:

* A Data-driven firewall is a type of firewall that uses data to make security decisions, but it is not specifically designed to protect against web application attacks.
* A Packet firewall is a type of firewall that examines individual packets of data, but it does not have the capability to analyze the content of the packets, which is necessary to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks.
* A Stateful firewall is a type of firewall that examines the state of network connections, but it does not have the capability to analyze the content of web application traffic, which is necessary to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks.",C,C,1
145,"Jane is working as a security professional at CyberSol Inc. She was tasked with ensuring the authentication
and integrity of messages being transmitted in the corporate network. To encrypt the messages, she
implemented a security model in which every user in the network maintains a ring of public keys. In this
model, a user needs to encrypt a message using the receiver's public key, and only the receiver can decrypt the
message using their private key. What is the security model implemented by Jane to secure corporate
messages?
A.  Zero trust network
B.  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
C.  Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
D.  Web of trust (WOT)
","The security model implemented by Jane to secure corporate messages is the ""Web of Trust"" (WOT).

In this model, every user in the network maintains a ring of public keys, which is a form of public key infrastructure (PKI). When a user wants to send a message to another user, they encrypt the message using the recipient's public key. Only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt the message.

The Web of Trust model is based on the idea that users can trust messages that come from users they have a pre-established relationship with, based on their shared public keys. This model relies on the concept of a ""web"" of trust, where users are connected to each other through a network of public keys.

The other options are not correct:

* Zero Trust Network (A) is a security model that assumes that all users and devices are untrusted, and that access to corporate resources should be controlled based on the identity and context of the user or device.
* Transport Layer Security (TLS) (B) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) (C) are cryptographic protocols used to secure online communications between a web browser and a web server.

146,"A DDOS attack is performed at layer 7 to take down web infrastructure. Partial HTTP requests are sent to the
web infrastructure or applications. Upon receiving a partial request, the target servers opens multiple
connections and keeps waiting for the requests to complete.
Which attack is being described here?
A.  Desynchronization
B.  Slowloris attack
C.  Session splicing
D.  Phlashing
","The correct answer is B. Slowloris attack.

A Slowloris attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that is performed at Layer 7, which means it targets the application layer of the OSI model. It involves sending a partial HTTP request to the target server, which causes the server to keep waiting for the rest of the request to arrive. This results in the server opening multiple connections and consuming system resources, effectively taking down the web infrastructure or application.

In contrast:

* Desynchronization is a type of attack that aims to disrupt the synchronization between clients and servers, but it's not typically associated with Layer 7 attacks.
* Session splicing is a type of man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker intercepts and modifies HTTP sessions, but it doesn't involve sending partial requests to take down the infrastructure.
* Phlashing is a type of DoS attack that involves sending a large amount of data to a server, but it's typically performed at Layer 4, which is the transport layer of the OSI model.",B,B,1

A.  vendor risk management
B.  Security awareness training
C.  Secure deployment lifecycle
D.  Patch management
","The correct answer is D. Patch management.

The Equifax data breach was caused by a known vulnerability in Apache Struts, which was available for patching by the software vendor. The fact that a fix was available for several months prior to the intrusion suggests that the patch management process failed. This is because it appears that the patch was not applied to the affected system(s) in a timely manner, allowing the vulnerability to be exploited.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

A. Vendor risk management: While vendor risk management is an important process, it is not directly related to the patching of vulnerabilities. This process typically involves assessing the risk of third-party vendors and managing those risks.

B. Security awareness training: Security awareness training is not directly related to the patching of vulnerabilities. This process typically involves educating employees on security best practices and phishing attacks.

C. Secure deployment lifecycle: While an secure deployment lifecycle is an important process, it is not directly related to the patching of vulnerabilities. This process typically involves deploying software securely, including patching vulnerabilities.

In this case, the failure was likely due to a lack of timely patching, which is a key aspect of patch management.",D,D,1
